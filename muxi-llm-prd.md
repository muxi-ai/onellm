# muxi-llm: Product Requirements Document

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Product Vision

muxi-llm will be a lightweight, provider-agnostic Python library that offers a unified interface for interacting with large language models (LLMs) from various providers. The library will follow the OpenAI client API design pattern, making it familiar to developers already using OpenAI and enabling easy migration for existing applications.

### 1.2 Business Objectives

1. Provide a standalone, open-source library that simplifies LLM integration
2. Serve as a dependency for the MUXI Framework, replacing its current model implementations
3. Establish a community-friendly, Apache 2.0 licensed package that encourages contributions
4. Create a foundation for future LLM-related innovations within the MUXI ecosystem

### 1.3 Success Metrics

1. Complete support for at least 5 major providers in initial release
2. Successful integration with the MUXI Framework
3. 95% or higher test coverage

## 3. Technical Architecture

### 3.1 High-Level Architecture

muxi-llm will follow a modular architecture with these key components:

1. **Core API Layer** - Public classes that implement the OpenAI-compatible interface
2. **Provider Layer** - Adapters for each supported LLM provider
3. **Configuration System** - Handles settings from various sources
4. **Utilities** - Helpers for streaming, retries, token counting, etc.
5. **Type System** - Shared data models and types

### 3.2 Detailed Architecture

```

### 3.3 External Dependencies

The library will minimize external dependencies to avoid conflicts:

1. **Required Dependencies:**
   - `requests` - For HTTP requests to provider APIs
   - `pydantic` - For data validation and settings management
   - `PyYAML` - For configuration file parsing
   - `aiohttp` - For async API calls

2. **Optional Dependencies:**
   - `tiktoken` - For token counting with OpenAI models
   - Provider-specific client libraries (when beneficial)

### 3.4 API Contract

The public API will follow these patterns:

#### ChatCompletion

```python
class ChatCompletion:
    @classmethod
    def create(cls,
               model: str,
               messages: List[Dict[str, Any]],
               stream: bool = False,
               **kwargs) -> Union[ChatCompletionResponse, AsyncGenerator]:
        """Create a chat completion."""
        pass

    @classmethod
    async def acreate(cls,
                     model: str,
                     messages: List[Dict[str, Any]],
                     stream: bool = False,
                     **kwargs) -> Union[ChatCompletionResponse, AsyncGenerator]:
        """Create a chat completion asynchronously."""
        pass
```

Similar patterns will be implemented for `Completion` and `Embedding` classes.
