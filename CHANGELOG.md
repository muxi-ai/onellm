# CHANGELOG

## 0.20251013.0 - Semantic Caching

**Status**: Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable

### New Features

- **Semantic Caching**: Blazing-fast in-memory cache with intelligent semantic matching
  - **42,000-143,000x faster responses**: Cache hits return in ~7µs vs 300-1000ms for API calls
  - **50-80% cost savings**: Dramatically reduces API costs through intelligent caching
  - **Zero ongoing API costs**: Uses local multilingual embedding model (`paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2`)
  - **Two-tier matching**: Hash-based exact matching (~2µs) with semantic similarity fallback (~18ms)
  - **Streaming support**: Artificial streaming for cached responses preserves natural UX
  - **TTL with refresh-on-access**: Configurable time-to-live (default: 86400s / 1 day)
  - **50+ language support**: Multilingual semantic matching out of the box
  - **LRU eviction**: Memory-bounded with configurable max entries (default: 1000)

### Cache Configuration

```python
import onellm

# Initialize semantic cache
onellm.init_cache(
    max_entries=1000,           # Maximum cache entries
    p=0.95,                     # Similarity threshold (0-1)
    hash_only=False,            # Enable semantic matching
    stream_chunk_strategy="words",  # Streaming chunking: words/sentences/paragraphs/characters
    stream_chunk_length=8,      # Chunks per yield
    ttl=86400                   # Time-to-live in seconds (1 day)
)

# Use cache with any provider
response = onellm.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="openai/gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum computing"}]
)

# Cache management
stats = onellm.cache_stats()    # Get hit/miss/entries stats
onellm.clear_cache()            # Clear all entries
onellm.disable_cache()          # Disable caching
```

### Performance Benchmarks

- **Hash exact match**: ~2µs (2,000,000% faster than API)
- **Semantic match**: ~18ms (1,500-5,000% faster than API)
- **Typical API call**: 300-1000ms
- **Streaming simulation**: Instant cached response with natural chunked delivery
- **Model download**: One-time 118MB download (~13s on first init)

### Technical Details

- **Dependencies**: Added `sentence-transformers>=2.0.0` and `faiss-cpu>=1.7.0` to core dependencies
- **Memory-only**: In-memory cache for long-running processes (no persistence)
- **Thread-safe**: OrderedDict-based LRU with atomic operations
- **Streaming chunking**: Four strategies (words, sentences, paragraphs, characters) for natural streaming UX
- **TTL refresh**: Cache hits refresh TTL, keeping frequently-used entries alive
- **Hash key filtering**: Excludes non-semantic parameters (`stream`, `timeout`, `metadata`) from cache key

### Documentation

- **New docs**: Comprehensive `docs/caching.md` with architecture, usage, and best practices
- **Updated README**: Highlighted semantic caching in Key Features and Advanced Features
- **Updated docs**: Added caching to `docs/README.md`, `docs/advanced-features.md`, and `docs/quickstart.md`
- **Examples**: Added `examples/cache_example.py` demonstrating all cache features

### Use Cases

**Ideal for:**
- High-traffic web applications with repeated queries
- Interactive demos and chatbots
- Development and testing environments
- API cost optimization
- Latency-sensitive applications

**Limited for:**
- Stateless serverless functions (short-lived processes)
- Highly unique, non-repetitive queries
- Contexts requiring strict data freshness

## 0.20251008.0 - ScalVer Adoption

**Status**: Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable

### Versioning Change

- **ScalVer Adoption**: OneLLM now uses [ScalVer (Scalable Calendar Versioning)](https://scalver.org) instead of Semantic Versioning
  - Version format: `MAJOR.YYYYMMDD.PATCH` (daily cadence)
  - Current version: `0.20251008.0` (October 8, 2025)
  - MAJOR = 0 indicates alpha/experimental status per ScalVer convention
  - DATE segment uses daily format (YYYYMMDD) for maximum release flexibility
  - PATCH increments for multiple releases on the same day
  - ScalVer is SemVer-compatible, so existing tooling continues to work
  - Provides clear calendar-based release tracking while maintaining compatibility guarantees

### Why ScalVer?

ScalVer offers the best of both worlds:
- **Time-based clarity**: Know exactly when a release was made from the version number
- **SemVer compatibility**: All existing package managers and tooling work unchanged
- **Flexible cadence**: Daily format allows for rapid iteration and hotfixes
- **Breaking change tracking**: MAJOR version still signals breaking changes
- **Tool support**: Every ScalVer tag is syntactically valid SemVer 2.0

For more information about ScalVer, visit [scalver.org](https://scalver.org).

### Async Reliability

- Replaced manual event loop creation with `utils.run_async`, letting synchronous APIs safely reuse running loops in notebooks and web frameworks.
- Added Jupyter-aware fallbacks (`nest_asyncio`) and clearer guidance when sync methods are invoked from async contexts.
- Published `utils.maybe_await` to normalize sync/async callables across helpers.

### Input Validation Guardrails

- Introduced `onellm.validators` to enforce safe ranges for temperature, token limits, penalties, stop sequences, and related parameters.
- Added provider-aware model validation so invalid OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, and other model names fail fast with actionable messages.

### Secure File Handling & Streaming

- Hardened `File.upload`/`File.aupload` by sanitizing filenames, enforcing extension and MIME allowlists, and streaming-safe size limits for files, bytes, and file-like objects.
- Propagated validated filenames through every provider while closing directory traversal, TOCTOU, and race-condition gaps surfaced in review.
- Stabilized Amazon Bedrock streaming with aligned async usage, higher timeouts, and queue handling fixes.

### Testing & Security Evidence

- Added dedicated unit and integration coverage for async helper behavior, file validation, and provider upload regressions.
- Captured proactive security scan results and remediation reports documenting the hardening work.

## 0.1.4 - Vercel AI Gateway & 2025 Model Updates

## 0.1.3 - Cache Metrics & GLM Provider

**Status**: Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable

### Enhancements

- **Cache-Aware Usage Metrics**: Extended `UsageInfo` with `*_cached`/`*_uncached` counts while keeping totals intact for billing parity.
  - OpenAI adapter now surfaces cache hits via `prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens`.
  - Anthropic adapter maps `cache_read_input_tokens` / `cache_creation_input_tokens` into the unified schema.
  - All consumers continue to receive `total_tokens` plus new fields defaulting to 0 when providers omit cache data.

### New Providers

- **GLM (Zhipu AI)**: Added OpenAI-compatible provider targeting `https://api.z.ai/api/paas/v4`.
  - Enables access to GLM-4 model family with streaming, JSON mode, tool calling, and vision support.
  - Reads credentials from `GLM_API_KEY` or the `ZAI_API_KEY` environment variable.

### Maintenance

- Adjusted configuration loader to accept multiple environment variable aliases per provider.
- Added focused unit tests covering cache usage normalization and GLM provider initialization.

## 0.1.2 - OpenAI Provider Compatibility Updates

**Status**: Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable

### Bug Fixes

- **OpenAI Provider Parameter Updates**: Fixed compatibility issues with newer OpenAI models
  - Automatically converts `max_tokens` to `max_completion_tokens` for all OpenAI models
  - Removes `temperature` parameter for GPT-5 and o-series models that only support default temperature
  - Ensures compatibility with GPT-5, o1, o3, and future OpenAI model releases
  - Backward compatible - existing code using `max_tokens` continues to work without changes

### Technical Details

- Models starting with `gpt-5` or `o` now have temperature parameter automatically removed
- All OpenAI API calls now use `max_completion_tokens` instead of deprecated `max_tokens`
- Changes are transparent to users - no code modifications required
