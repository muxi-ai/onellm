## Future Roadmap (Post 0.1.0)

### Additional Providers

#### Phase 1: OpenAI-Compatible Providers (Easier Implementation)
These providers offer OpenAI-compatible APIs, making them simpler to implement:

- [ ] **OpenRouter** - Unified interface to 100+ models
- [ ] **Together AI** - Fast inference for open models
- [ ] **Groq** - Ultra-fast LPU inference
- [ ] **Fireworks AI** - Fast open model inference
- [ ] **Google AI Studio** - Gemini models via OpenAI-compatible API
- [ ] **Perplexity AI** - Search-augmented models
- [ ] **Replicate** - Model versioning and deployment
- [ ] **DeepSeek** - Chinese LLM provider
- [ ] **Mistral AI** - European AI models
- [ ] **Anyscale Endpoints** - Scalable open model hosting
- [ ] **HuggingFace Inference Endpoints** - Custom model hosting

#### Phase 2: Native API Providers (Custom Implementation)
These providers require custom implementations for their native APIs:

- [ ] **Anthropic** - Claude models
- [ ] **Azure OpenAI Service** - Microsoft-hosted OpenAI models  
- [ ] **AWS Bedrock** - Multiple model providers (Claude, Llama, etc.)
- [ ] **Vertex AI** - Google Cloud's Gemini API (separate from AI Studio)
- [ ] **Cohere** - Native API

*Note: While OpenAI-compatible wrappers exist for some Phase 2 providers, implementing against their native APIs provides better reliability, full feature access, and official support.*

#### Phase 3: Local Model Providers
For running models locally:

- [ ] **Ollama** - Local model management and serving
- [ ] **llama.cpp** - Direct C++ inference integration

## Development Prerequisites

### API Keys Needed for Provider Development
To implement and test new providers, API keys are required for each service:

#### Phase 1 Providers (OpenAI-Compatible - Priority)
- [ ] **OpenRouter** - Sign up at https://openrouter.ai/
- [ ] **Together AI** - Sign up at https://api.together.xyz/
- [ ] **Groq** - Sign up at https://console.groq.com/
- [ ] **Fireworks AI** - Sign up at https://fireworks.ai/
- [ ] **Perplexity AI** - Sign up at https://www.perplexity.ai/
- [ ] **DeepSeek** - Sign up at https://platform.deepseek.com/
- [ ] **Mistral AI** - Sign up at https://console.mistral.ai/

#### Phase 1 Providers (OpenAI-Compatible - Priority)
- [ ] **OpenRouter** - Sign up at https://openrouter.ai/
- [ ] **Together AI** - Sign up at https://api.together.xyz/
- [ ] **Groq** - Sign up at https://console.groq.com/
- [ ] **Fireworks AI** - Sign up at https://fireworks.ai/
- [ ] **Google AI Studio** - Sign up at https://aistudio.google.com/

### Feature Flag Implementation Notes
Each provider implementation must include capability flags in the provider class:

```python
class NewProvider(Provider):
    # Required capability flags
    json_mode_support = True/False
    vision_support = True/False
    audio_input_support = True/False
    streaming_support = True/False
    realtime_support = True/False
    function_calling_support = True/False
    
    # Model-specific capabilities can be defined per model
    def get_model_capabilities(self, model: str) -> Dict[str, bool]:
        # Return model-specific capabilities
        pass
```

### Development Process for Each Provider
1. **Research Provider API** - Study documentation and capabilities
2. **Obtain API Key** - Sign up and get credentials for testing
3. **Implement Provider Class** - Create new provider inheriting from `Provider`
4. **Set Capability Flags** - Define what features the provider supports
5. **Add Model Mappings** - Map provider models to OneLLM naming convention
6. **Write Tests** - Create comprehensive test suite
7. **Add Examples** - Create usage examples in `/examples/`
8. **Update Documentation** - Add provider to README and docs

### Additional Features (Beyond 0.1.0)
- [ ] Add a unified "realtime" API
