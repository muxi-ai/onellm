## Remaining Work

### Phase 1 (continued): Complete OpenAI Provider
- [ ] Add multi-modal support for OpenAI (vision, audio, TTS, DALL-E)
- [ ] Expand test coverage for multi-modal features
- [ ] Add examples for multi-modal functionality

### Phase 2: OpenAI-compatible Providers

- [ ] Add Anyscale provider
- [ ] Add Fireworks AI provider
- [ ] Add Groq provider
- [ ] Add Mistral AI provider
- [ ] Add Azure OpenAI provider
- [ ] Add Perplexity AI provider
- [ ] Add other OpenAI-compatible providers as needed

### Phase 3: Non-OpenAI API Providers
- [ ] Implement Anthropic provider
- [ ] Implement Ollama provider
- [ ] Add HuggingFace compatibility
- [ ] Create adapter layer for providers with unique APIs

### Documentation and Testing

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Complete multi-modal support for OpenAI provider
2. Add examples for multi-modal features
3. Expand test coverage for OpenAI provider
4. Begin implementation of additional OpenAI-compatible providers (Phase 2) only after OpenAI provider is fully complete
