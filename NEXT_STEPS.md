## Future Roadmap (Post 0.1.0)

### Additional Providers (Completed in v0.0.7+)

#### OpenAI-Compatible Providers ✅
These providers offer OpenAI-compatible APIs, making them simpler to implement:

- [x] **OpenRouter** - Unified interface to 100+ models
- [x] **Together AI** - Fast inference for open models
- [x] **Groq** - Ultra-fast LPU (Language Processing Unit) inference
- [x] **XAI (Grok)** - Elon Musk's AI company, 128K context window
- [x] **Fireworks AI** - Fast open model inference
- [x] **Google AI Studio** - Gemini models via OpenAI-compatible API
- [x] **Perplexity AI** - Search-augmented models
- [x] **DeepSeek** - Chinese LLM provider
- [x] **Mistral AI** - European AI models

#### Native API Providers ✅
These providers use custom implementations for their native APIs:

- [x] **Anthropic** - Claude models
- [x] **Azure OpenAI Service** - Microsoft-hosted OpenAI models
- [x] **AWS Bedrock** - Multiple model providers (Claude, Llama, etc.)
- [x] **Vertex AI** - Google Cloud's Gemini API (placeholder implementation)
- [x] **Cohere** - Native API with RAG capabilities

#### Local Model Providers ✅
For running models locally:

- [x] **Ollama** - Local model management with dynamic endpoint routing
- [x] **llama.cpp** - Direct GGUF model execution with Python bindings

#### Additional Features Implemented
- [x] **Model Download Utility** - CLI tool to download GGUF models from HuggingFace
- [x] **Dynamic Endpoint Routing** - Ollama supports `model@host:port` syntax
- [x] **Model Caching** - llama.cpp caches loaded models for performance

### Providers Still To Implement
- [ ] **Anyscale Endpoints** - Scalable open model hosting
- [ ] **HuggingFace Inference Endpoints** - Custom model hosting
- [ ] **Replicate** - Model versioning and deployment

## Development Prerequisites

### API Keys Status (All Implemented)

### Feature Flag Implementation Notes
Each provider implementation must include capability flags in the provider class:

```python
class NewProvider(Provider):
    # Required capability flags
    json_mode_support = True/False
    vision_support = True/False
    audio_input_support = True/False
    streaming_support = True/False
    realtime_support = True/False
    function_calling_support = True/False

    # Model-specific capabilities can be defined per model
    def get_model_capabilities(self, model: str) -> Dict[str, bool]:
        # Return model-specific capabilities
        pass
```

### Development Process for Each Provider
1. **Research Provider API** - Study documentation and capabilities
2. **Obtain API Key** - Sign up and get credentials for testing
3. **Implement Provider Class** - Create new provider inheriting from `Provider`
4. **Set Capability Flags** - Define what features the provider supports
5. **Add Model Mappings** - Map provider models to OneLLM naming convention
6. **Write Tests** - Create comprehensive test suite
7. **Add Examples** - Create usage examples in `/examples/`
8. **Update Documentation** - Add provider to README and docs

### Additional Features (Beyond 0.1.0)
- [ ] Add a unified "realtime" API
