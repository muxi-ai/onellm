# muxi-llm: Next Steps

This document outlines what has been accomplished so far in the muxi-llm package and what tasks remain to be completed.

## Completed Work (Phase 1)

### Core Architecture
- [x] Established a provider-agnostic architecture
- [x] Created a consistent provider/model naming convention ("provider/model")
- [x] Implemented a provider interface with factory pattern
- [x] Built public API classes that mirror OpenAI's interface
- [x] Created a flexible configuration system

### Error Handling
- [x] Created a comprehensive error taxonomy
- [x] Implemented standardized error handling across providers
- [x] Added provider-specific error mapping

### OpenAI Provider
- [x] Implemented chat completion functionality (sync/async)
- [x] Added support for streaming responses
- [x] Implemented text completion functionality
- [x] Built embedding support
- [x] Added file operations (upload/download)
- [x] Added multi-modal support for vision (images in chat)
- [x] Added multi-modal support for audio transcription/translation

### Utilities
- [x] Created retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- [x] Implemented streaming utilities
- [x] Added token counting for various models

### Documentation and Examples
- [x] Added comprehensive docstrings
- [x] Created basic examples for chat completion and embedding
- [x] Added example for vision capabilities
- [x] Added examples for audio transcription/translation
- [x] Documented public API

### Testing
- [x] Implemented initial tests for OpenAI provider
- [x] Added tests for vision capabilities
- [x] Added tests for audio transcription/translation

## Remaining Work

### Phase 1 (continued): Complete OpenAI Provider
- [ ] Add multi-modal support for text-to-speech (TTS)
- [ ] Add multi-modal support for image generation (DALL-E)
- [ ] Expand test coverage for remaining multi-modal features
- [ ] Add examples for remaining multi-modal functionality

### Phase 2: OpenAI-compatible Providers
- [ ] Add Together AI provider
- [ ] Add Anyscale provider
- [ ] Add Fireworks AI provider
- [ ] Add Groq provider
- [ ] Add Mistral AI provider
- [ ] Add Azure OpenAI provider
- [ ] Add Perplexity AI provider
- [ ] Add other OpenAI-compatible providers as needed

### Phase 3: Non-OpenAI API Providers
- [ ] Implement Anthropic provider
- [ ] Implement Ollama provider
- [ ] Add HuggingFace compatibility
- [ ] Create adapter layer for providers with unique APIs

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement abstraction layer for real-time audio/video API
  - [ ] Frame sampling and batching from video streams
  - [ ] Stateful context management between frames
  - [ ] WebRTC integration interface
  - [ ] Adaptive rate limiting based on provider capabilities
  - [ ] Fallback mechanisms for service interruptions

### Documentation and Testing
- [ ] Expand test coverage for all providers
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Add more examples for different use cases

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Complete remaining multi-modal support for OpenAI provider (TTS, image generation)
2. Add examples for all multi-modal features
3. Expand test coverage for OpenAI provider
4. Begin implementation of additional OpenAI-compatible providers (Phase 2) only after OpenAI provider is fully complete
